A simple, powerful, self-contained HTML application that allows you to render Mermaid.js diagrams locally and export them as high-resolution PNG images. No need for external websites, subscriptions, or an internet connection after the initial page load.

üöÄ Features
Fully Local & Private: Runs entirely in your browser. Your data and diagrams never leave your computer.

High-Resolution Export: Export diagrams at any resolution using a simple scale factor‚Äîno more blurry screenshots!

Live Preview: Instantly see your diagram update as you type.

Single File Solution: The entire tool is one .html file. Easy to save, share, and use anywhere.

Error Handling: Provides clear feedback if your Mermaid syntax is incorrect.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
Download: Save the mermaid-creator.html file to your local machine.

Open: Open the file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

Create: Paste your Mermaid diagram code into the text area on the left.

Set Quality: Adjust the Resolution Scale value. A higher number (e.g., 8 or 10) results in a larger, higher-quality PNG file.

Generate: Click the Generate Diagram button to see your flowchart in the preview pane.

Download: Click the Download as PNG button to save the final image to your computer.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The application leverages a combination of standard web technologies to provide a seamless experience:

HTML: Structures the user interface, including the code editor, control buttons, and the diagram preview area.

CSS: Provides the clean, modern styling for the application, ensuring it is responsive and easy to use.

JavaScript: Powers the core logic of the application.

Mermaid.js Library: The script dynamically loads the Mermaid.js library from a CDN. This library is responsible for parsing the Mermaid syntax and converting it into an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) image.

DOM Manipulation: When you click "Generate Diagram," the script takes the code from the text area, uses the Mermaid API to render the SVG, and injects it into the preview pane.

Canvas API for Export: To create a high-resolution PNG, we can't just save the SVG. Instead, the script performs the following steps when you click "Download":

It reads the dimensions of the generated SVG.

It creates a new, hidden <canvas> element in memory, scaled up by the Resolution Scale factor.

It draws the SVG onto this larger canvas, effectively rasterizing it at a high resolution. A white background is added to ensure transparency isn't an issue.

Finally, it converts the canvas content into a PNG data URL and triggers a download link, saving the high-quality image to your device.
